Describe Your Idea

Proposed system would enable secure and private transaction for online purchases 
either with your credit cards, debit cards or even a checking account without 
carrying any plastics or checkbook. This will also enable purchasing without 
giving out any personal information of any sort. Any time user wants to do any 
financial transaction he/she creates a new one using his/her mobile device. 
Google wallet is convenient and already solves part of the problem but you need 
to use Google services and abide by its terms. Google and other ecosystems are 
convenient but they are becoming new walled gardens. This could be another tool 
to avoid credit card frauds especially online transaction frauds.
Value Proposition

 Benefits to End Users:
- End user doesn’t need to carry or keep track of plastics or check books.
- Protect user’s personal information from proliferating across the globe.
 - We strongly believe that the retailers don’t need (and store) customers 
personal information to complete the transaction. Retailers can't misuse user 
data (like sharing or selling it to others as there is nothing to misuse).
- Convenient way of fastest money transfer to their close friends or family 
members in urgent need. Imagine a friend is travelling in New York City and 
he/she is in dire need of immediate money because he/she has lost all the 
belongings. In this scenario a Sender creates a virtual-transaction with all the 
details including a secret code (similar to a debit card pin #) and gives this 
information (a string) to the receiver over the phone who in turn uses it at ATM 
machine (or special kiosks at 7Elevan or 24-hr stores) to cash in.       
- It's like a Cash transaction in Digital world.
 
Benefits to the “Providers” (Banks, Credit Card companies or other financial 
institutions):
- No need to design, manufacture and distribute millions of credit, debit cards 
or checks year after year, saving paper and plastic. 
 - They don't need to keep track of lost/stolen cards,
 -  May need to worry less about loss of millions of dollars to financial fraud 
due to lost/stolen cards.  The rapid growth of credit card use on the internet 
has made database security lapses particularly costly. Whenever it happens 
millions of accounts have been compromised at a time. Today’s fraud detection 
systems are designed to prevent a very small percent of all transactions 
processed which still translates into billions of dollars in losses (Business 
Applications of Neural Networks by Bill Edisbury).         
 
Benefits to the Retailers:
 - They can be protected from the use of fraudulent credit cards. In year 2009 
BestBuy Inc., lost $100 million worth of goods to a gang of hackers/thieves who 
used stolen credit card information to place the orders online.
 - Retailer’s benefit tremendously by getting personal information of their 
customer which they can use for targeted advertising. With the proposed system, 
users personal information is protected. To mitigate this issue, we are 
suggesting another piece of information which can be as anonymous as possible 
like an email address could be used to advertise the products to individual 
customer. Email addresses can also be used to send out the receipts.
Your Solution

- In the proposed system, both retailer and Provider needs to sign-up with 
‘Intel Service’. This is like a router service which receives a 
virtual-transaction from the participating retailer and forwards it to the 
correct participating provider along with retailer information in encrypted 
form. Rest of the transaction completes as usual.
-  For end user, there will be application (mobile or web) with common interface 
to all "Providers". User inputs a name for a transaction (optional), assign 
expiration date (optional), amount, and a pin code (optional and can be 
different every time if needed). The input process can be automated with few 
rules to make it more convenient.
-  Then user submits to a "Provider" of choice at the time, who in turn 
generates an encrypted string or a number with a bar code (can simply be scanned 
at the brick-and-mortar store).
- User can use this encrypted token/number at online merchant (for e.g. amazon), 
which internally could decrypt enough information to know about "Provider". This 
gets sent to a Provider who can authenticate, decrypt and complete the 
transaction marking it as "complete" in the system.
- These transactions will have default expiration date/time so that transaction 
becomes obsolete after validity period or use.- Every provider can have their 
own encrypt/decrypt technology. This gives user a freedom and improves mobile 
banking experience.  "Providers" will certainly need to use Intel's best and 
fast server technology with dedicated encryption/decryption circuitry to provide 
faster service.

Market Opportunity

1) TAM (Total available market): From my market research and reports I have 
read, I found out that the total number of mobile payment users will reach 448 
million users by 2016 from 212.2 million in 2012, according to Gartner, Inc. 
This presents huge opportunity in the mobile payment space. The number of U.S. 
digital shoppers is expected to grow from 137 million in 2010 to 175 million in 
2016, according to eMarketer estimates (www.statista.com)
The US mobile payment market is expected to reach 
(http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/16/forrester-u-s-mobile-payments-market-predicted-to-reach-90b-by-2017-up-from-12-8b-in-2012/) 
90 Billion by 2017.
2) SAM (Serviceable Available Market): In this space PayPal has the highest 
market share (in terms of customer who uses PayPal solution) of around 100 
million customers. Other customers are being served by Google using NFC 
technology along with individual solutions by each major credit card companies. 
This technology could be integrated with retailers/providers using NFC based 
solution for payment processing. 
3) SOM(Serviceable Obtainable Market): My strategy is to work with Major bank(s) 
or a Credit Card companies to enable this idea, and develop an application 
interface for retailer to use this system (as payment or complete POS system). 
After going to market I'm expecting signup of at least 1% of 100 million of 
PayPal's customer or new customers from uBid.com or similar auction sites, of 
around 1 million customers to start using this system in the first year. In this 
case I'm assuming 10 million transactions a month with 0.5% charge per 
transaction would generate approx. $600,000 by first year. This is very 
realistic and reachable target by end of first year of deployment. With growth 
rate (new customers and transactions) of 10% in next 2 years, my revenue will be 
$12M by year 3. Additional revenue will be generated by anonymous data analysis 
services to the retail sector and urgent money transfer services from a users 
bank account via ATM or 24-Hrs store network like 7-Elevan.
Competitive Landscape

Mobile payments market is growing very fast with many new startups and also 
products from incumbents like Paypal, and Intuit. PayPal’s “Here” is a service 
is similar to SquareUp with better features. There are other companies like 
Braintree that are providing encrypted tokens to make payments. There is 
significant traction for PayPal services in the market due to brand recognition. 
“SquareUp”, “SumUp”, “iZettle”, “Payleven” and other companies are providing 
mainly card readers (dongle based) for the individual sellers or small 
businesses to carry out mobile payments with customers. They charge 2-3 % of the 
transaction as a fee. PayPal’s “Here” is an App based but still charges the same 
fee. We are charging a small fee for letting our customers use the service and 
they also get the benefit of anonymous transaction.
Amazon is also working on a patent for anonymous transaction.  
Our sustainable advantage is being able to protect all the entities i.e. banks, 
consumers from fraud due to loss of credit cards or credit card info while 
providing banks with more revenue thru small businesses who can use our service 
with much lesser overhead. We have the added benefit of collecting data (though 
anonymous) that is location based that has invaluable to marketers. Encrypted 
card readers can be easily hacked since they are used repeatedly with same 
encryption. Our encryption system can use different encryption technologies and 
can be dynamically changed by providers making it difficult to hack into the 
private data.
Go To Market Model and Value Chain

We will partner with credit card processing getaways and banks to enable 
processing credit card, debit card and check transactions. We will target online 
retailers and small businesses in local geography as our first customers. We 
will market to them directly and through small business associations. We will 
also target online 'Apps' seller like individual opensource software developers 
and non-profit organizations by developing a generic browser plugin to make 
accessible this new payment system.
Business Model

Our customers are small business owner or individual who currently uses service 
like PayPal. The customers will pay us a percentage of their revenue of the 
transactions. We will charge a fee to the merchants. For all successful 
transactions this will be deducted before money is transferred to their account 
thru the bank card processing gateways.
For a $100 transaction the business owner will get $99.50 minus the bank credit 
card fees if any. We will provide customer service through email and phone or 
online chat support.
We will also enable to easy but authorized money transfer services through the 
bank and their ATM network. There would be a small fee will be applied for the 
use of this service paid by the sender (this will behave like a collect phone 
call system).
Market Acceptance

Looking at the various Payment services and there are quite a few of them, 
PayPal's “Here” service and Braintree’s “token” based payment service are some 
examples where this idea has been accepted by consumers and merchants.
Risk Assessment

Our assumptions/risks are as follows,
- Support from financial institutions (Providers) is a must for this 
idea/solution to be deployed and successful. All providers are ready to change 
the workflow that currently exists for most of the transactions that use credit 
card,
- The consumers (users of this product) are increasingly adoptive of  the idea 
and ready to change their habit of using plastic cards, and
-- The continued increases of mobile devices for financial transactions.
 
Final Comments

Financial Opportunity

 I'm assuming 10 million transactions a month with 0.5% charge per transaction 
would generate approx. $600,000 by first year. With growth rate (new customers 
and transactions) of 10% in next 2 years, my revenue will be $12M by year 3. 
Additional revenue will be generated by anonymous data analysis services to the 
retail sector and urgent money transfer services from a users bank account via 
ATM or 24-Hrs store network like 7-Eleven. Software stack will be built using 
open source software saving licensing fees. I'm assuming 20% cost for the use of 
cloud infrastructure from lthe likes of Amazon, Rackspace. Tags: secure

  This is good idea, because i don't want to give personal information to 
  merchants. It's comfortable for me to create transaction with Provider, and 
  get something like transaction voucher(without personal information). With 
  this voucher merchants can get money from Provider.

  Joyce, thanks for you comments. Precisely merchants ONLY needs to get the 
  money in return for the product they sell. They don't need any personal 
  information about you. It's like 'Cash payment' The process can  be automated 
  with software solution for e.g. extending Google wallet functionality to 
  create and use auto-transaction-id.

  But you still need something to get you identified against the merchant. I can 
  think on several cases: tax regulations will require it, what happens if you 
  want to return the goods, what if you want to complain for a missing piece, 
  what if you want to be recognized as a loyal customer with some miles-like 
  program.
  Do you have something in mind that can cope with those scenarios?

  Andres,
  I appreciate your comments/questions. It's true that customer may need to show 
  an identification but more than 90% vendors don't even ask you that (it's not 
  an requirement), the rate is 100% for online purchases. Whenever there is a 
  requirement, customer can show valid photo-id but vendor doesn't need to store 
  that information (unless it's require by any law). About returns, Returns are 
  processed similarly. Vendor can use old/used transaction-id to track the 
  previous transaction (either printed on the paper or an email receipt) for 
  return purposes. It goes through the same path. Return always credit the 
  amount to the same account it came from. Vendor doesn't need to store any user 
  specific information. Recognition of a loyal customer is different issue (in 
  this case user is willing to give his/her personal information). But I think 
  this can be solved using email address as a tag (which can also be use 
  send/receive receipts). So even though transaction id is different, it could 
  belongs to the same email address.
  Miles like programs are normally tagged with 'Credit' Card usage, that can 
  still be implemented as it is, no change requires.  
  In nutshell, it's like 'Cash Payment (always anonymous) in Digitial World'

  Hi Uttam.  It sounds like a better solution than what is currently done.  I 
  have a couple concerns however.
  1. This sounds like it creates several extra steps the consumer needs to go 
  through before they can make a purchase.  That won't help adoption.  At a 
  minimum, any new system will have to be at least as easy to use as the current 
  system, preferably easier.
  2. Most identity theft doesn't happen by the provider abusing your personal 
  information.  It happens when that information is compromised during 
  transmission or viruses on the consumers device.  In essence, you are changing 
  the transaction of personal data from Consumer->Provider to Consumer->Bank.  
  Until a more secure solution can be made between the consumers devices and 
  whoever they are trying to communicate with, changing the steps you go through 
  won't have a large impact imho.
  I don't do any banking or purchasing on my phone or tablet.  Not because I'm 
  afraid of the Provider abusing me, but because I am not confident in the 
  security used to send my information.

  Tom,
  Good questions. Currently, customer swipes the credit/debit card or uses check 
  payment at the counter. While this solution indeed have few extra steps in 
  it's simplest form mainly, first creation of a transaction-string with 
  provider of choice with at least one input field viz., amount to be paid 
  (other fields are optional since expiration date/time for a transaction_id can 
  have default value, You may or may not need pincode if you are going to use it 
  immediately, retailer name is optional). But as a complete automated solutions 
  in combination with third party option like "Google Wallet" or "Own wallet 
  solution", mobile device can be use to read the amount from the retailer 
  payment system, then customer only selects a provider using the mobile device, 
  it send a request to the provider, which in turn creates a new transaction 
  string and sends it to the mobile device, which in turn can be transmitted 
  over to the retailers payment system thus avoiding most of the manual steps.
  In the current system there are just too many players. Everyone involved 
  except customer has or needs to build their own solution to keep/save your 
  personal information which also increases the probability of loosing that 
  information. In last 5-to-6  years most if not all banks has somekind of 
  online banking solution, this has happened because of increased confidence of 
  eveyone involved. For some cases like the doubts you have about online 
  security, I thought about extending traditional phone banking solution to 
  generate the "transaction-string". After few inputs/questions, system just 
  reads you your new 'transaction-string'. This is an attempt to solve the 
  privacy concerns while still keeping it convenient and not allowing anyone and 
  everyone to use our personal information for their own financial gain. Since 
  each transaction-string is generated by a 'Provider' and is valid for short 
  amount of time, it will greatly reduce the fraud. Customers can use pincode if 
  needed for added security. Again this should help further reducing fraud.

  Credit cards are easy to use for majority of the people. All you need is sign 
  in the back and carry it with you. The banks already have this included in 
  their cost. Also printing credit cards is not their main business. Why would 
  they change their workflow is really the question.
  User has to remember the pincode. This is not what all users can manage very 
  well.

  Sanjay,
  Yes there is an established path but there is always an opportunity to 
  improve. I think this is one of them. Compare to 5 years ago, now there are 
  3-to-4 times more online customers (137 million). This increase has also 
  caused increase in online fraud since you don't need to provide any proof of 
  ownership of the card you are using. Most of the other data you need like 
  billing address (which doesn't change frequently) can be easily obtained from 
  many other sources. I think this solution would provide more security and 
  convenience without sacrificing any personal information.

  Seems like a very interesting idea -- perhaps, we can look into trying this 
  into some biometric information (say fingerprint readers) that would obviate 
  the need for PINs and so forth. Of course, there are privacy concerns 
  regarding where this information would be stored and how we could authenticate 
  that the user is actually present (and not some fascimile of the user's 
  fingerprints, etc.), but it's something that can be explored as a complete 
  platform solution.

  Atul,
  That is an interesting thought. As far as storing "Providers" information on 
  the mobile devices, I was thinking of current implementation of Google Wallet. 
  I've not explored the internal working of Google Wallet yet. My description of 
  "Pin" is more of dynamic nature, not static like Debit card pin generated and 
  assigned by a "Bank". With my solution you can make up pin as and when needed 
  (depending on security need). You may not need any pin if the purchanse is 
  immediate. Like in completely automated solution. "Biometric" data can be used 
  in securing the whole "Mobile" device/platform but there remains the question 
  of storage (who and where, etc.). I'll think more about it,  thanks for your 
  input.
